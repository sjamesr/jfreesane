/**
 * Implementations of this interface can receive notifications when certain events happen during a
 * page scan. To receive notifications, use the {@link SaneDevice#acquireImage(ScanListener)}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>If you are only interested in a subset of these events, you may want to extend {@link
 * ScanListenerAdapter} instead of implementing this interface.
 *
 * <p>If you are using {@code ScanListener} to update a user interface, the frequency of
 * notifications (specifically from {@link #recordRead}) may be too frequent. In this case, you can
 * wrap your listener using one of the methods in {@link RateLimitingScanListeners} to obtain a
 * listener that drops notifications occurring too frequently.
 *
 * <p>Notifications will tend to occur as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code scanningStarted} -- once a page scan has commenced
 *   <li>{@code frameAcquisitionStarted} -- once for each frame. Typically there is only one frame
 *       per page, but in older three-pass color scanners (where one scan pass is made per color),
 *       there will be three frames per page
 *   <li>{@code recordRead} -- once for each record, one or more records make up a frame
 *   <li>{@code scanningFinished} -- once a page has been scanned
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>JFreeSane attempts to report accurate numbers to listeners, but this is not possible in all
 * cases. In general, you should not depend on data obtained from the listener when this could
 * affect program correctness.
